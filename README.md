Add-on for [Lyetzi's Gunners Mod](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/lyetzis-gunners-mod.547/).

The following guns have been completed:

  1. [DKS-501 Reservist's Rifle](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Reservist's_rifle)
  2. [DKS-501 Gobi Campaign Scout Rifle](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Gobi_Campaign_scout_rifle)

To see just the assets used for each weapon, they have been isolated to their own branches (e.g., `feature/gs_dks501`).
